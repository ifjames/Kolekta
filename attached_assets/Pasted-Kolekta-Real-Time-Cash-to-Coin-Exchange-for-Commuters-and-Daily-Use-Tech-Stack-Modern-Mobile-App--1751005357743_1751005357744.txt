Kolekta—Real-Time Cash-to-Coin Exchange for Commuters and Daily Use
Tech Stack: Modern (Mobile App)
In cash-driven economies like the Philippines and many other parts of the world, the simple act of paying the exact fare or receiving the right amount of change can often become a frustrating, time-consuming problem. Whether you're riding a jeepney, tricycle, or bus or simply buying at a sari-sari store, being unable to get change for your ₱500 or ₱1000 bill can be a daily inconvenience. Conversely, vendors and small business owners are often overloaded with coins and small bills they want to consolidate into higher denominations for safekeeping or banking purposes. Kolekta is a first-of-its-kind mobile app built to solve this daily cash flow problem. It is a real-time, peer-to-peer cash denomination exchange platform that connects individuals who need coins or smaller bills (barya) with those who want to consolidate small change into larger bills (buo), and vice versa.
Rationale
In cash-based societies like the Philippines, daily transactions, especially in public transportation, street vending, and small stores, rely heavily on the availability of exact change or smaller denominations of cash (coins or small bills). However, many people encounter problems when “Wala ka ba barya? ”:
They only have large bills (₱500, ₱1000), and the driver/vendor has no change.
Vendors or store owners accumulate too many coins or small bills and have difficulty consolidating them into higher denominations.
Commuters struggle to pay exact fares due to limited access to coins.
ATMs often dispense high-denomination bills, making it harder for people to transact in exact amounts.


These daily inconveniences may seem small, but they add up to wasted time, disrupted service, payment rejections, and unnecessary stress.
Kolekta addresses this gap by providing a real-time, peer-to-peer mobile platform for exchanging cash denominations. It empowers users to solve their own cash flow problems collaboratively, without relying on third parties like banks, stores, or terminals. It decentralizes the exchange of money not digitally, but physically and socially.

Use Case Scenarios:
1. Commuter Needs Barya
Ana is heading home from work and only has a ₱1000 bill. She knows the jeepney driver won’t have change. She posts on Kolekta:
 "Need change for ₱1000 (any smaller bills/coins). Will give exact ₱1000 bill."
 Within 5 minutes, she matches with someone nearby wanting a ₱1000 bill in exchange for small bills. They meet at a convenience store.
2. Vendor Needs Buo
Mang Reynaldo runs a small store and has tons of ₱20s, ₱50s, and coins. He wants to bundle them into ₱500 or ₱1000 bills for depositing. He posts on Kolekta and finds someone nearby willing to do the reverse.
3. Student Needs Exact Coins
Leo needs ₱20 in coins to pay for a tricycle, but all he has is a ₱100 bill. He uses Kolekta and connects with someone nearby who wants to collect coins and is offering a ₱100 bill in exchange.
4. During Events/Peak Hours
During fiestas or rush hour in terminals, many users will be short on coins or have too much small change. Kolekta helps balance the ecosystem by letting users swap what they have for what they need instantly.
